These sequences were generated using an automated process.  The normal regions have around 5% CG content,
while the CpG regions should have closer to 20%.  This is artificial and does not exactly match what you
will find in the contigs from HCM21, however it is a good starting point for testing your code.  The 
files contain sequences with only the characters ACTG and with 70 characters per line (except the last
line of course).
